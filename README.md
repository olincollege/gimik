# GIMIK

### Project Summary
GIMIK is a simple CAD software that allows the user to create, remove, scale, and move geometric shapes. It features a GUI and automatically-scaling axes, along with highlighting selected objects for an improved user experience. GIMIK's input fields are robust against improper input, the software can handle numerous shapes, and the software can natively save an image of the current workspace.

### Installation
Our program requires Python to be installed. If it is not already installed, we recommend doing so using Anaconda. The installation instructions can be found on the [Anaconda Documentation website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

Alternatively, you could follow [these instructions](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-python-on-linux).

We are using libraries built into Python to create the program, so no other installation is required.

### Usage 

Clone this repo to your local machine and navigate to the gimik folder.

Run `python main.py` to start the gimik program.

Instructions:
* Use the buttons on the screen to create, select, and remove shapes. 
* The shape that is selected will turn yellow. 
* Use the entry boxes on the bottom of the screen to scale and move the shapes by a chosen value.

**Note** that for the figure to reload, you must right click the screen.
