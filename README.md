# GIMIK
### Project Summary
GIMIK is a simple CAD program ...

### Installation
Our program requires Python to be installed. If it is not already installed, we recommend doing so using Anaconda. The installation instructions can be found on the [Anaconda Documentation website](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

Alternatively, you could follow [these instructions](https://realpython.com/installing-python/#how-to-install-python-on-linux).

We are using libraries built into Python to create the program, so no other installation is required.

### Usage 

Clone this repo to your local machine and navigate to the gimik folder.

Run `python main.py` to start the gimik program.

Instructions:
* Use the buttons on the screen to create, select, and remove shapes. 
* The shape that is selected will turn yellow. 
* Use the entry boxes on the bottom of the screen to scale and move the shapes by a chosen value.

**Note** that for the figure to reload, you must right click the screen.
