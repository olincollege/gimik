## What is GIMIK?
GIMIK is a simple CAD software that allows the user to create, remove, scale, and move geometric shapes. It features a GUI and automatically-scaling axes, along with highlighting selected objects for an improved user experience. GIMIK's input fields are robust against improper input, the software can handle numerous shapes, and the software can natively save an image of the current workspace.
